# üìò Machine Learning Course ‚Äì Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains my homework assignments for a university-level Machine Learning course. Each notebook includes hands-on implementations of core ML algorithms and techniques, completed as part of the coursework. The goal of these notebooks is to deepen theoretical understanding through practical experimentation using Python and libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
